mass planet is compressed into a point mass with a gravitational softening of 0.17 au or 0.017 au , for planets at 50 au and 5.2 au respectively .", "this means that the gravitational potential well is narrower and deeper in this case than in the gi simulations .", "therefore , the gas can release more energy into heat while accreting to the planet .", "this can be understood with the accretional luminosity formula : @xmath70 where a smaller planetary radius , @xmath71 , gives a larger accretional luminosity for the same planet mass , @xmath72 , and the same accretion rate , @xmath73 . as we discussed in the previous section , in the gi simulation ,", "eventually the protoplanetary core would collapse to a few jupiter radii , which suggests the system will begin to look more like the ca case in terms of gravitational potential profile , and thus , the release of heat as gas flows inward would also become more similar .", "this would imply that the cpd temperatures should become alike in the gi and ca cases .", "however , we pointed out in the previous section that the angular momentum budget of the planet plus cpd is significantly different in the two cases .", "this implies that the collapse will be different at all times . in the gi simulation", ", the cpd will shrink more slowly with time as angular momentum has to be removed at all radii in order for the collapse to proceed , and it may even gain angular momentum from the collapsing core due to angular momentum transport via bar - like and spiral instabilities .", "@xcite found that when the latter happens , the cpd becomes nearly keplerian and reaches centrifugal equilibrium around the protoplanetary core . as a result", "the cpd temperature remains low , below 100 k. while this late - stage evolution will have to be re - addressed with new , even higher resolution global simulations , it already suggests that the remarkable difference in cpd temperatures between the two formation mechanisms should persist on long timescales , well beyond @xmath74 years .      in the case of the gravitational instability simulations , a steady state can not be reached by the end of the simulations . a clump of a few jupiter masses is expected to collapse into bona -

accretion simulations , because the temperature remains the same in the gi circumplanetary disk , irrespective of the collapse .", "therefore , the fact that we can not follow the birth of the planet  i.e. the full collapse of the clump  does not change the conclusion regarding the orders of magnitude difference in circumplanetary gas temperature between the ca and gi simulations .", "the time - scales of core - accretion and disk instability formation mechanisms are very different : the former takes place on @xmath79 years , while the latter is @xmath80 years long . therefore , our two sets of simulations describe a slightly different epoch of the circumstellar disk .", "our gi simulation represents a very early stage in the circumstellar disk evolution , perhaps during the class i phase , while the core -

order riemann - solvers which are not the method of choice in our code @xcite ; therefore , it is possible that temperatures are overestimated . on the other hand", "the gi simulation does not include flux limited diffusion approximation radiative transfer .", "nevertheless , we tested the temperature of the gi simulation by comparing it to a low resolution flux limited diffusion approximation simulation and confirmed that they result in a very minimal difference for the cpd temperature . in this respect ,", "our conclusion concerning the major difference between the early stage of the cpd in the gi and ca simulation is robust .", "one may wonder how our conclusion would change during the subsequent evolution in the gi case after our simulation is ended , since the collapse of the planet is continuing and steady state was not reached .", "however , there is another key difference between our two sets of simulations that keeps our conclusion valid on a longer timescale : the total angular momentum budget of the planet plus subdisk system . indeed , as we have have explained in section [ sec : dens ] , the cpd in the gi case has more than an order of magnitude higher angular momentum than the corresponding ca case .", "we also checked that the gi cpd , due to its large radius and low density , is toomre stable , with @xmath81 at all times .", "this implies that rapid dynamical angular momentum transport via self - gravitating instabilities will not operate , but a more gentle transport can happen by global non - axisymmetric instabilities ( see in @xcite ) .", "the @xmath82 core in the gi simulation would contract to a few a jupiter radii in @xmath60 years , during which time the cpd can reach centrifugal equilibrium due to internal angular momentum transport between the collapsing core and the subdisk .", "if the cpd is threaded by a magnetic field , it may become magneto - rotationally unstable @xcite , but for realistic values of viscosity ( @xmath83 ) , the evolutionary timescales will be long ( @xmath84 years ) . hence we can safely conclude that the cpd by itself is a long - lasting structure despite the fact that the inner protoplanetary core has not reached steady state and will continue to collapse further . instead , what will likely happen is that part of the cpd could be stripped by tides if the clump plunges inward on its eccentric orbit and reaches less than 10 au .", "therefore , we predict that for gi clumps , either an extended , cold cpd is present for up to @xmath85 years , or there is no cpd if it has been lost by tides during migration . in no case", "do we expect a hot cpd akin to that in the core - accretion case .    in the case of our solar system , where the giant - planets were most likely formed via core - accretion", ", the integrated mass of jupiter s and saturn s satellites makes up @xmath86 of the planetary mass . assuming the interstellar medium value for the dust - to - gas ratio ( i.e. 1% dust )", ", this would mean a minimum mass for the cpd of 2% of the masses of our two largest gas - giants .", "however as @xcite pointed out , this mass has to be processed during the entire satellite growth timescale , i.e. it does not all have to be present at one given instant of time .", "the reason is that the cpd is not a closed reservoir of mass , unlike the circumstellar disk .", "the subdisk is fed by the circumstellar disk , and loses mass through the accretion onto the planet .", "therefore , the subdisk mass is not constant in time , but depends on the feeding and mass loss balance , and it changes as the circumstellar disk evolves and the planet grows . given that our sun probably had a rather low mass circumstellar disk , the circumplanetary disks around our gas - giants must have had low masses too . in other planetary systems , however , where the protoplanetary disk mass is higher ( at present , or at earlier stage ) , the cpd mass can be also higher and can result in more massive , more extended satellite systems .    in the disk instability model", ", there might also be a second generation of subdisks forming around the fully fledged giant planets .", "indeed , if protoplanets migrate inward to @xmath87 au , their hill radius will shrink ; therefore , the cpds can be stripped away by tides almost entirely @xcite . in this case", ", only a dense protoplanetary core is left , which can survive even at orbital radii of @xmath441 au at the densities found at the end of our gi simulation . since massive protoplanets in massive self - gravitating disks", "can migrate inward on timescales of @xmath60 year , we argue that detection of the original cpds formed by disk instability is more likely in the early evolutionary phase of the protoplanetary disk , before the class ii stage . later", ", a new subdisk might be accreted by the newly formed gas giant , but it will be much more compact than the first population of gi subdisks .", "these second generation of cpds probably will have thermodynamic properties analogous to core - accretion subdisks , given that they formed around fully fledged giant planets .", "if such a second generation exists , then the cpds between the two formation mechanism will not likely differ much .", "in this paper we compared the main characteristics ( mass & temperature ) of circumplanetary disks around core accretion and gravitational instability formed gas giants .", "we used state - of - the - art hydrodynamic simulations with as similar initial parameters as possible to reveal the key differences between the subdisks of the two main planet formation scenarios .", "the core accretion simulations were carried out with the jupiter code , featuring a radiative module with the flux limited diffusion approximation and mesh refinement .", "the disk instability simulations were performed with the changa smoothed particle hydrodynamic code , matching the resolution of the grid - based simulations and having a radiative cooling calibrated to flux limited diffusion results .", "we ran three core accretion and one disk instability simulation with 10 jupiter - mass planets in massive circumstellar disks ( 158 , 290 and 600 @xmath48 ) . in two core accretion simulations the planets had a semi - major axis of 5.2 au", ", the third simulation featured a gas - giant at 50 au distance from its star . in the gi calculations the semi - major axis was also 50 au for our chosen , 10 jupiter - mass protoplanet , although the orbit varied a bit through interactions with other clumps .", "we found from the core - accretion simulations that the subdisk mass linearly scales with the circumstellar disk mass , even in these radiative simulations .", "this means that core accretion cpds can be nearly as massive as their gi counterparts , if the protoplanetary disk has the same mass . in the 0.6 @xmath54 circumstellar disks , the ca simulation resulted in a cpd with a mass of 12% @xmath88 , while we found a cpd mass of 50%-100% @xmath88 in the gi computation .", "previous works predicted a 4 - 5 orders of magnitude mass discrepancy , but we were able to show that was because of their orders of magnitude differences in circumstellar disk masses .", "on the other hand , our finding is that the temperature differs by more than an order of magnitude between the gi and ca formed cpds .", "according to the simulations , the bulk subdisk temperature is @xmath11 100 k in the case of disk instability , and over 800 k for all the ca computations presented in this paper .", "the reason for this discrepancy lies in the different gravitational potential wells and opacities . because the protoplanet is a few au wide extended clump in the gi simulations , while it is a fully formed giant planet with a radius of 0.17 au ( meaning the gravitational potential smoothing length ) in the ca-1 simulation , the accreted gas has significantly more energy to release into heat in the latter case than in the former .", "the large temperature contrast between ca and gi circumplanetary disks provides a convenient tool for observations on young , embedded planets to distinguish between the two main formation mechanisms .", "we thank for the anonymous referee for the thoughtful review , which helped to improve the paper .", "j. szulgyi acknowledges the support from the eth post -

gun signature of dm annihilations .    a natural place to search for imbhs may be the known dwarf satellite galaxies about the milky way ; however , the physics that govern the formation of these objects is still a topic of much debate and uncertainty , so such a search may be subject to the same drawbacks as searches for radiation near the center of the galaxy .", "however , as we have already stressed , these imbh formation scenarios have as a virtue that they predict that there may be hundreds of detectable objects within the galactic halo , most of which would not be associated with the known population of dwarf satellite galaxies .", "an imbh population similar to the one in the milky way halo should be present in andromeda , given its similarity to the galaxy in terms of size and mass .", "moreover , the distance to the andromeda imbhs would be between @xmath142  kpc , amounting to a factor of only a few more in distance than to the black holes of the outer mw halo .", "hence the detection of such imbhs in andromeda may be possible in optimistic scenarios and may serve to demonstrate the ubiquity of such phenomena .    as a further implication", ", we found that the annihilation luminosity from any milky way - like halo may be dominated by annihilation around imbhs in optimistic scenarios .", "as an example , we showed that in scenario b , the total luminosity of an individual mini - spike , in terms of annihilation radiation , may be comparable to the luminosity of the entire host halo .", "therefore , such optimistic scenarios provide a significant `` boost factor '' for the gamma -

be a delta function at the diffraction condition ) .", "nevertheless , we see that the values extracted from the lorentzian width are quite close to the langevin friction values which were obtained by

and langevin simulations .", "a major difference between these two approaches is the substitution of the dynamic substrate which is explicitly simulated by the md code , with a friction damping term and a stochastic force in the langevin simulation . since this substitution can not accurately account for correlations between the relative motion of the substrate and adsorbate atoms which takes place in the md , a certain discrepancy in the simulated dynamics is anticipated .", "for example , a substrate phonon creates a time dependent distortion of the potential energy surface on which the adsorbate moves , hence one could expect that the rate of single jumps and longer jumps would be affected by the frequency and amplitude of the substrate vibrations . while it is obvious that such correlations will take place to some degree , a quantitative assessment of the discrepancies was missing in the literature , and it was unclear whether they are sufficiently large to affect the interpretation of realistic ( noisy ) experimental data .", "the observables we chose to compare are the isf and dsf correlation functions , focusing on the width of the quasi - elastic peak , @xmath15 , in particular .", "the dependence of the quasi - elastic peak width on the momentum transfer and sample temperature provides a sensitive measure of the motion rate and mechanism , and is also accessible to helium scattering experiments@xcite .", "the comparison we performed showed that for the particular systems we simulated , the two simulations can produce very similar observables , using the friction parameter as the only free parameter used to fit the two .", "thus , within the conditions we simulated , correlation effects do not seem to lead to any noticeable discrepancies between the two simulations , and the langevin simulations provides a good approach for simulating the surface dynsmics .", "we did notice that the optimal friction values which we obtained from fitting the two simulations increased slightly with temperature , an effect which was more significant for adsorbates with a higher mass .", "one possible interpretation of this observation is that the need to increase the friction parameter of the langevin simulation at higher temperatures is an indication of a discrepancy between the two numerical approaches ( i.e. we are compensating for fundamental differences between the two simulations by adjusting the fit parameter ) .", "another interpretation is that the frictional coupling rate is increasing with temperature in the md simulation and that the comparison with the langevin simulation ( which produces an optimal friction parameter ) is simply revealing this fact .", "we used the quasi - elastic base width as a method to estimate the frictional coupling from the dephasing rate of the motion within the adsorption site and extract effective friction values from the md data .", "our results show that the effective friction values extracted using this method , are in close proximity to those used to fit the langevin simulation .", "furthermore , the effective friction values also show an increase with temperature supporting the second interpretation mentioned above , i.e the frictional coupling increases with temperature in the md simulation and the need to adjust the friction parameter of the langevin simulation to fit the two simulations does not indicate a discrepancy between the two numerical approaches .", "in conclusion , when using the particular interaction models mentioned above , adsorbate masses ranging from 23 to 200 amu , and temperatures within the range of 140k to 300k , we do not observe significant differences between the langevin and md simulations .", "thus , even if differences exist , they are subtle and should not affect the analysis of experimental data with similar or larger noise levels", ". an explanation for this lack of discrepancy , might be that the relatively fast time scales which characterize the substrate motion lead to an averaging effect which reduces the importance of explicit correlations and allows us to treat the interaction as a sum of a static interaction ( pes ) and a stochastic force with a good accuracy .", "it is also worth noting , that in the past when applying langevin simulations for data analysis , it was assumed that the friction is independent of surface temperature .", "while the particular trend we observed in the md simulation reflects our choice of model for simulating the substrate ( harmonic potential ) and adsorbate ( morse potential ) and is not directly related to other systems and interaction models , it is worth remembering that the friction might change as function of temperature also in other systems .", "if this temperature dependence is not negligible and is not taken into account , systematic errors might be produced when extracting physical properties from the simulations , in particular the energy barrier for diffusion deduced from arrhenius graphs .", "finally , we assume that there will be other systems and conditions under which correlations will produce noticeable effects , however , these will probably require substantially different time scales ( faster adsorbate motion or slower substrate motions ) and it should be interesting to study such systems in the future .", "the authors would like to thank prof .", "erio tossati for valuable scientific discussions .", "this work was supported by the israeli science foundation ( grant no .", "2011185 ) and the

modes [ e.g. 108 ] , where the e - mode is at a few percent of the cmb anisotropies , but the level of the much weaker b - mode is largely unknown .", "however , the b - mode is needed to disentangle different inflation models [ 109 ] .", "sensitive observations of a northern and southern target selected for cmb polarization ( cmbp ) observations [ 110 ] by the bar -
